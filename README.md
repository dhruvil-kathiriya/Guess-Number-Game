## Guess The Number Game
A fun browser-based game built with JavaScript where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts.

### How To Play
When the page loads, a random secret number between 1 and 20 is generated that the player tries to guess.

The player enters a number in the input field and clicks "Submit Guess" to submit their guess. They are notified if their guess is too high or too low.

The player has 10 attempts to try to guess the number correctly. Their remaining guess count is displayed and decreed after each incorrect guess.

If the player guesses the number within 10 attempts, a success message is displayed. If they fail to guess correctly after 10 attempts, a failure message is shown along with the correct number.

The player can click "Play Again" to play a new round with a newly generated secret number.
